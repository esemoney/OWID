    "# Analyzing the Effects of COPD: A Comparative Study of the United States and Uganda\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive and often fatal respiratory condition that poses a significant global health challenge. Accurate comparison of COPD's impact across different countries is crucial for informing public health policies and interventions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the cases of COPD in the United States and Uganda by calculating and comparing crude and age-standardized death rates, two essential metrics for evaluating the impact of this chronic respiratory condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crude death rate is the most basic measure of mortality - it simply tells you the total number of deaths from a cause per 100,000 population in a given year or period. It's calculated by summing up all the deaths, dividing by the total population, and multiplying by 100,000. It however does not account for differences in the age structures of different populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age is one of the biggest risk factors for most diseases and causes of death especially for chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD. A population with a higher proportion of elderly people will naturally have more deaths than a younger population, even if the age-specific death rates are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where age-standardization comes in where I calculated mortality rates by age group first, and then took a weighted average of these age-specific rates using a predetermined population age distribution. This \"standard\" population distribution is meant to be representative and facilitate better  comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Health Organization provides one such standard million population that is commonly used. For each age group, you calculate the age-specific rate in your population, multiply it by the standard weight for that age group from the WHO million, and sum these weighted rates up. Then divide by the total of the standard weights to get the final age-standardized rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I aimed to answer the question - \"What would the crude death rate be in my population, if my population had the same age distribution as the WHO standard million population?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Age-standardization allows us to make apples-to-apples comparisons between populations with different age structures. It removes the distorting effect of age and isolates the risk factor(s) you are interested in studying, like country, race, socioeconomic status and so on. In this case, the **country**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using age-standardization, we effectively remove the influence of age distribution, focusing solely on the geographical (country) variable as the risk factor of interest. This enables us to assess whether one country has a higher risk of COPD deaths than the other when age is not a confounding factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis leverages three data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UN World Population Prospects (2022)**  â€” Population Estimates 1950-2021\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **WHO Standard Population**: The World Health Organization (WHO) Standard Population serves as a reference for age-standardization, allowing for the calculation of age-standardized death rates. This approach accounts for differences in population age structures, facilitating meaningful comparisons between countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Age-specific Death Rates for COPD**: This provided table - transformed to a dataset -  contains age-specific death rates for COPD in the United States and Uganda for the year 2019, serving as the foundation for calculating both crude and age-standardized rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*The primary goal of this analysis is to calculate and compare the crude and age-standardized death rates for COPD in the United States and Uganda. By examining these rates, we can gain insights into the relative burden of COPD in each country and assess the potential impact of population age structures on the observed patterns.*\n",
