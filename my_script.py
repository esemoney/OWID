This script calculates the crude and age-standardized death rates for COPD in the United States and Uganda for the year 2019. The process involves three main steps: data preparation, calculation of crude death rates, and calculation of age-standardized death rates using the WHO standard population. Assumptions made include the use of the WHO standard population for all age-standardization processes and the consideration that the provided COPD death rates are accurate and comprehensive. The goal is to provide a clear comparison of COPD mortality between the two countries, adjusting for age distribution differences.
